#description: chatServer.js is the server side, chat-frontend.js is the client side

#to run the project : first of all
    * run these commands :
        npm install websocket
        npm install redis
        (although i provided the node_modules with the solution but run the commands to make sure)
        i am using node v-5.4.1
#Now run the server:  node chatServer.js

#Open the client side : frontend.html on any server any port and it will work fine (use chrome or mozilla firefox it works fine)

ps : you need to install redis properly if you are using windows
